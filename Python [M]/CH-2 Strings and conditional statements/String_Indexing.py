'''
Indexing :
index -- position

for example : 
str = Apna_College
in this string 
A p n a _ C o l l e g  e
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11
A is at index 0 
p is at index 1
and so on
'''


# Used for ACCESSING the elements in the string.
# Ex: 
str = "Apna_College"
#str[0] = A
#str[1] = p
#and so on

# Note: We can access the elements in the string but cannot modify or assign value in it
# Ex: str[0] = 'B' will give error
# Because strings are immutable in python
# But we can modify the string using slicing and other methods

'''
Two types of indexing :
1. Positive Indexing :
   A   P   P   L   E
   0   1   2   3   4
2. Negative Indexing
   A   P   P   L   E
  -5  -4  -3  -2  -1

Note: accessing elementss can also be done through negative indexing.
