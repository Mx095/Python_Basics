# OOP in Python: To map with real world scenarios, we started using objects in code.
'''
Same as we evolved from using procedural codes to using functions in code
(which reduces redundancy and increases resuability of code),
we evolve to Object oriented programming.

# Class & Object in Python:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Class: A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines the variables and functions that are common
to all objects of a particular type.
Object: An object is an instance of a class. It is a concrete representation of a class.
